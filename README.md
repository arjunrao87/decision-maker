- If you are developing on the Mac, the iOS simulator comes for free ( via xcode )

- If you want to try it on an Android Emulator, you will need to follow the expo steps for using the Android emulator ( I use Genymotion )

- When the Expo app loads up on the simulator and you are figuring out how to get the Decision maker started up, hit the + sign and paste the url from the Expo IDE into this simulator. The app should come up successfully.
